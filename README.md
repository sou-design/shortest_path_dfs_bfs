# shortest_path_dfs_bfs
DFS and BFS are two graph search algorithms. 

BFS(Breadth-First Search) : BFS begins at a root node and inspects all the neighboring nodes. Then for each of those neighbor nodes in turn, it inspects their neighbor nodes which were unvisited, and so on

DFS(Depth First Search) : We donâ€™t visit the nodes level by level! As long as there is an unvisited node adjacent to the current visited node we continue! Once we are stuck, trace back and go to a different branch!
